# Alamien-Bank-Queue-Management-System-MIPS-MARS
A MIPS assembly implementation of a bank queue management system (ABQMâ„¢) using MARS MIPS Assembler. Tracks queue length (Pcount) and waiting time (Wtime), supports up/down counting, and manages queue flags (empty/full). Includes C models, MIPS code, and test cases. Ideal for learning MIPS architecture and queue systems.
